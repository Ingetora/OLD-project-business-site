# Business Site

Used the same skeleton for this as in my previous project, because i thought it fit perfectly.

Making a babysitting site for my daugther.

## The problem

Well, the accordion was hard. Did not get Max tutorial to work, had to use one I googled. The same happended with the responsive images for the hero part. Did not get it to work as Max showed us. SÃ¥ frustrating not finding your own errors. Did get the hero images to work using min-width instead os max-width. Puh!
